# Concept

This Is A laravel Based multi-tenant blog system, The web flow of this app is multi faceted in the sense that it has a dashboard for both the Admin and Tenants(users), at the web flow each tenant can only access their own posts and they can only perform CRUD Operations on their own Posts Only, But at the web flow, Admins can access and perform CRUD Operation on All Tenant(users) Post, This Was enforced through the aid of Laravel Policies. Admins can approve a registered user and add them as a tenant after approval. Admin can also Deactivate/Activate and Delete Tenants(users) account.

At The API Flow, Tenants can perform CRUD Operations only on their Own Post and Admins Can Also Manage Tenant's Posts. This Was Enforced using the aid of laravel policies.
